# Pattern Recognition

This repository contains the assignments made for the course Pattern Recognition at Utrecht University (2022). 
For the first assignment, we analysed the MNIST dataset and had to come up with the best features to classify the data on. 
For the second assignment, we adjusted the U-net architecture of the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic model in order to improve temporal dynamics for videos.
